# Tips and Trick
#   Auto-Completion
Download the Git source code, and look in the contrib/completion directory;
there should be a file called git-completion.bash. Copy this file to the 
home directory, and add this to your .bashrc file:
	source /usr/local/git/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
